# this file demonstrates the CLI steps that are necessary to arrive at

# bcm command line utility is verified. You're probably in good shape
# if you can type 'bcm' and have help show up. Consider appending these
# commands to your ~/.bashrc so its your default environment (useful for 
# development)
