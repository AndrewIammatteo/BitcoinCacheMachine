If you're already running Linux, you can probably run BCM directly on bare-metal. This is preferred from a performance perspective since we can avoid hardware virtualization. If running BCM in a bare-metal environment, it is recommended the device be dedicated to the task and exist on a private-VLAN-enforced DMZ.
