# How to Run BCM

If you can run modern Ubuntu, you can run BCM. BCM runs on bare-metal Ubuntu 18.04 or can operate inside a full VM-based on Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 instance. Please remember that BCM is for testing purposes only and is under heavy development. BCM should be considered for evaluation purposes only.

* Run BCM in a QEMU/KVM-based VM (see ./docs/installation/multipass.md)
* On bare-metal (see ./docs/baremetal.md)
* On someone elses computer (discouraged, but if you must) (see ./docs/installation/inthecloud_aws.md)

BCM is meant for home and small office use in-line with the spirit of decentralization. BCM is menat to provide a performant and secure software-defined network for LAN segments (Layer 3 broadcast domains).
