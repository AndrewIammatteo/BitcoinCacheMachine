[ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This wiki holds all the long form descriptions of warnings and suggestions it outputs. If you get this output:

```
$ shellcheck myscript
In myscript line 5:
eof
   ^-- SC1118: Delete whitespace after the here-doc end token.
```

and it's too terse or you're not sure whether it applies, you can read more on this wiki page: [[SC1118]].

On [ShellCheck.net](http://www.shellcheck.net), you can just click the error code to go to this page.


If you would like to contribute and create a page, just copy the [[Template]] and give it a name like [[SC1000]], and bask in unending appreciation from shell scripters world wide!
