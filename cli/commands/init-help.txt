  bcm init  Initialize your localhost to become an SDN controller (mgmt plane) for your BCM deployments.
            This tool creates installs docker, and creates a docker image that contains all the software
            that are needed to manage BCM clusters and deployed projects. This command creates new GPG 
            certificates, so have your Trezor handy.

Usage:
  bcm init --cert-name="BCM backup/recovery" --cert-username="bob" --cert-fqdn="domain.com"

Options:
  --cert-name=<BCM_CERT_NAME>           Required. The name that will appear in the PGP certificate.
  --cert-username=<BCM_CERT_USERNAME>   Required. The username that will appear in the GPG certificate.
  --cert-username=<BCM_CERT_FQDN>       Required. The FQDN that will appear in the GPG certificate.
  --cert-dir=<BCM_CERT_DIR>             Optional. Directory where public key material will be emitted.
                                        The default directory is $BCM_RUNTIME_DIR/certs. Use this feature to create
                                        arbitrary Trezor-backed GPG certificates for your own purposes.
