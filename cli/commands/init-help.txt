Description:
  bcm init  Initialize your computer to become a management plane for your BCM deployments.
            This tool creates $BCM_RUNTIME_DIR, installs docker, and creates a docker image that contains
            all the software you need to manage your clusters and the projects deployed on them.

            When that's complete, it's time to create your starting GPG certificates using the
            new docker image. You will be asked to plug in your hardware wallet during this process.
Usage:
  bcm init --cert-name="BCM backup/recovery" --cert-username="bob" --cert-fqdn="domain.com"

Options:
  --cert-name=<BCM_CERT_NAME>           Required. The name that will appear in the PGP certificate.
  --cert-username=<BCM_CERT_USERNAME>   Required. The username that will appear in the GPG certificate.
  --cert-username=<BCM_CERT_FQDN>       Required. The FQDN that will appear in the GPG certificate.
  --cert-dir=<BCM_CERT_DIR>             Optional. Directory where public key material will be emitted.
                                        The default directory is $BCM_RUNTIME_DIR/certs. Use this feature to create
                                        arbitrary Trezor-backed GPG certificates for your own purposes.
