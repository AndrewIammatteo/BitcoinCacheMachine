Description:
  bcm init  Initialize your localhost to become an SDN controller (mgmt plane) for your BCM deployments.
            This tool installs docker via snap, and creates docker images needed at the SDN controller. 
            This command creates new GPG certificates, so have your Trezor handy.

Usage:
  bcm init --name="BCM" --username="bob" --hostname="laptop"

Options:
  --name       Required. The name that will appear in the PGP certificate.
  --username   Required. The username that will appear in the GPG certificate.
  --hostname   Required. The FQDN that will appear in the GPG certificate.
  --dir        Optional. Directory where public key material will be emitted.
                    The default directory is whatever GNUPGHOME is set to. Consider setting
                    BCM_ACTIVE=0 in your SHELL to direct your trezor to your home directory.
