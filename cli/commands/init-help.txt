Description:
  bcm init  Initialize your localhost to become an SDN controller (mgmt plane) for your BCM deployments.
            This tool installs docker via snap, and creates docker images needed at the SDN controller. 
            This command creates new GPG certificates, so have your Trezor handy.

Usage:
  bcm init --cert-name="BCM" --cert-username="$USER" --cert-fqdn="$HOSTNAME"

Options:
  --cert-name=<BCM_CERT_NAME>           Required. The name that will appear in the PGP certificate.
  --cert-username=<BCM_CERT_USERNAME>   Required. The username that will appear in the GPG certificate.
  --cert-username=<BCM_CERT_HOSTNAME>       Required. The FQDN that will appear in the GPG certificate.
  --cert-dir=<GNUPGHOME>             Optional. Directory where public key material will be emitted.
                                        The default directory is $BCM_RUNTIME_DIR/certs. Use this feature to create
                                        arbitrary Trezor-backed GPG certificates for your own purposes.
