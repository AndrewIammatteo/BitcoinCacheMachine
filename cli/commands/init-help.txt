Description:
  bcm init  Initialize your computer to become a management plane for your BCM deployments.
            This tool creates ~/.bcm, installs docker, and creates a docker image that contains
            all the software you need to manage your clusters and the projects deployed on them.

            When that's complete, it's time to create your starting GPG certificates using the
            new docker image. You will be asked to plug in your hardware wallet during this process.
Usage:
  bcm init -n=test -u=ubuntu -c=domain.com

Options:
  -o=<BCM_CERT_DIR>       Directory where public key material will be stored. The default 
                          directory is ~/.bcm/certs.
  -n=<BCM_CERT_NAME>      Required. The name that will appear in the PGP certificate.
  -u=<BCM_CERT_USERNAME>  Required. The username that will appear in the GPG certificate.
  -c=<BCM_CERT_HOSTNAME>  Required. The domain name that will appear in the GPG certificate.
