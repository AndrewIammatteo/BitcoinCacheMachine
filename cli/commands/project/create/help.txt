  bcm project create <BCM_PROJECT_NAME> -u=<BCM_PROJECT_USERNAME> -c=<BCM_CLUSTER_NAME>

Required Flags:
      -u (--user-name)          The username to be used on the certificate data, e.g., testing/stagging/production.
                                See BCM documentation for other considerations regaring naming conventions.
      -c (--cluster-name)       The name of the intended cluster that the project is will be deployed to. Required.
