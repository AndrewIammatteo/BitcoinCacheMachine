Description:
  Create an LXD cluster so you can deploy your BCM projects to it.

Usage:
  bcm cluster create 

Example:
  Create an LXD cluster named 'dev'. Since '-t=lxd', LXD will be installed automatically using
  snap. Since '-x=net', the LXD remote endpoint will be exposed on the local network when your 
  
      bcm cluster create -c=dev -t=local -x=net

Parameters:
  --cluster-name=         The name of the new cluster. $BCM_RUNTIME_DIR/clusters/<BCM_CLUSTER_NAME> will 
                          be populated after successful cluster creation.
    
  --provider=             The provider is the mechanism by which an LXD instance will be made
                          available. Valid option as are 'local', 'ssh', and multipass.
                          
                          'local' installs LXD locally using snap and is recommended for testing 
                          and development. 

                          'ssh' creates a new cluster on a remote SSH endpoint.
                          
                          'multipass' install multipass as a snap and creates one or more QEMU-based
                          VMs on your local computer. Each VM will be cloud-init provisioned into a 
                          cluster configuration.

  --node-count=           Cluster node (lxd endpoint) count. Number of equal-size multipass VMs you 
                          want deployed. Only relevant when --provider=multipass.
