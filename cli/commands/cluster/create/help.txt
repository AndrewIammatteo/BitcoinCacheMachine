Description:
  Create an LXD cluster so you can deploy your BCM projects to it.

Usage:
  bcm cluster create 

Example:
  Create an LXD cluster named 'dev'. Since '-t=lxd', LXD will be installed automatically using
  snap. Since '-x=net', the LXD remote endpoint will be exposed on the local network when your 
  
      bcm cluster create -c=dev -t=local -x=net

Parameters:
  --cluster-name=         The name of the new cluster. $BCM_RUNTIME_DIR/clusters/<BCM_CLUSTER_NAME> will 
  <BCM_CLUSTER_NAME>      be populated after successful cluster creation.
                          --cluster-name=<BCM_CLUSTER_NAME>
    
  --provider=             The provider is the mechanism by which an LXD instance will be made
  <BCM_PROVIDER>          available. Valid option as are 'multipass', 'aws', and 'baremetal'. 
                          
                          'baremetal' installs LXD locally using snap and is recommended for 
                          testing and development. 
                          
                          'multipass' install multipass as a snap and creates one or more QEMU-based
                          VMs on your local computer. Each VM will be cloud-init provisioned into a 
                          cluster configuratino
                          
                          'aws/azure' NOT SUPPORTED. BCM is meant for home and small office.
  
  --node-count=           Cluster count. Number of equal-size multipass VMs you want deployed.
  <BCM_NODE_COUNT>  

  --onion-ssh             If this flag is set, a onion service will be created that exposes the 
                          endpoint's SSH service as an authenticated onion service allowing your to 
                          remotely administer your endpoint.

  --onion-lxd             If this flag is set, a onion service will be created that exposes the 
                          LXD daemon TLS endpoint as an authenticated onion service allowing your to 
                          remotely administer your BCM data center.
