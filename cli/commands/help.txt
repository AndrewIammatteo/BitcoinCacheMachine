Description:
  Command line client for Bitcoin Cache Machine. BCM's features can be driven through the various 
  commands below. In most cases, all you need to do is run "bcm stack deploy <STACK_NAME>" commands
  to deploy software to your active chain. Use "bcm info" to view your CLI Environment settings.
  Your BCM files are stored at BCM_RUNTIME_DIR ("env | grep BCM").

Usage:
  bcm [command] --help

Available Commands:
  init         Initialize your management plane; create new Trezor-backed GPG certificates.
  cluster      Create, destroy, and manage BCM clusters (i.e., LXD cluster). Add/remove new 
               computers to an existing cluster.
  deprovision  Deprovisions all LXC critical BCM data center components from active cluster.
               TODO - Note: this command retains all user-level data on disk.
  stack        Deploy and remove BCM software workloads (e.g., bitcoind, clightning, btcpayserver, etc.).
