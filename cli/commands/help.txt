Description:
  Command line client for Bitcoin Cache Machine. BCM's features can be driven through the various 
  commands below. If you just pulled BCM to your local machine and want to get started consider the 
  following steps. In general, you should only need to issue a `bcm stack deploy` command. Other
  top-level bcm commands may become available depending on deployed stacks, e.g., 'bcm bitcoin-cli'.

Usage:
  bcm [command] --help

Available Commands:
  init         Initialize your management plane; create new Trezor-backed GPG certificates.
  cluster      Create, destroy, and manage BCM clusters (i.e., LXD cluster). Add/remove new 
               computers to an existing cluster.
  deprovision  Deprovisions all LXC critical BCM data center components from active cluster. 
               User data in system-level btfs volumes is retained.
