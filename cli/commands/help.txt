Description:
  Command line client for Bitcoin Cache Machine. All of BCM's features can be driven through the various 
  commands below. If you just pulled BCM to your local machine and want to get started consider the 
  following steps:
  
    1) Initialize your SDN Controller and create new Trezor-backed GPG certificates and password store 
       using 'bcm init'.
    2) Create a new cluster using 'bcm cluster create'. Add cluster endpoints (new computers) to the cluster 
       by running 'bcm cluster add'.
    3) Deploy critical BCM data center components to all cluster endpoints using the 'bcm provision' command.
    4) Use 'bcm stack deploy <stack_name>' to deploy a Bitcoin-related software stack to the active cluster.

Usage:
  bcm [command] --help

Available Commands:
  init         Initialize your management plane; create new Trezor-backed GPG certificates.
  cluster      Create, destroy, and manage BCM clusters (i.e., LXD cluster). Add/remove new 
               computers to an existing cluster.
  provision    Provision critical BCM data center components.
  stack        Deploy and undeploy BCM software workloads (e.g., lnd, opentimestamps, etc.).
  git          Sign git commits and git tags using your Trezor-backed GPG certificates.
  file         Create and verify file signatures, encrypt and decrypt files with your Trezor.
  ssh          Use your Trezor to issue SSH keys and perform SSH authentication.
  pass         Create and manage GPG-encrypted passwords protected by your Trezor.
  info         Display current and target environment variables related to BCM operations.
  show         Show detailed LXC-related information for your active LXD endpoint.

Help
  Use "bcm [command] --help" to get help for that command.
