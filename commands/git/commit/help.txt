Description:
  Commit and GPG-sign a git repository using a Trezor for secure cryptographic 
  operations. All signature operations against a given git repo use your GNUPGHOME
  directory which can be viewed with 'bcm info'. '$GNUPGHOME/env' contains required 
  environment variables related to git commits using BCM.

Usage:
  bcm git commit --git-repo-dir=$HOME/git/repo \
                 --message='Git commit message.' 

Parameters:
  --git-repo-dir=    The path of the git repo you want to commit and sign. BCM_GIT_DIR by default.
  --message=         The required message to be included in the git commit.
