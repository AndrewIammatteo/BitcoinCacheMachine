Why is a compromise of your personal information a problem TO YOU? Ever received a scammy email or phone call? The more information you give to ANY PERSON--your grocery store or your doctor or your insurance company--or the government (remember the OPM hack?)--the GREATER the likelihood that your personal information will be compromised! Your privacy will ALWAYS be compromised when you disclose information (wittingly or unwittingly) to a third party!
