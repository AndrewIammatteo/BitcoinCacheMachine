# BCM Stacks

Each of the folders in this directory contains a BCM stack. BCM stacks are added to the BCM codebase when it seems interesting and when it integrates some way with bitcoind. Altcoins need not apply. BCM stacks may be dependent on other stacks. If this is the case, each stack first provision its dependencies as a first order of business.
