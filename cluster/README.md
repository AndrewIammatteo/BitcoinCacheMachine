BCM Clusters are nothing more than sets of machines that have been configured to operate in a LXD Cluster. By running a cluster of count 3 or more, you can achieve high availability. However, you can still deploy BCM to a single machine (or two).  You can even deploy a BCM cluster to the same computer as your SDN controller, which is great when all you have is your desktop computer.
